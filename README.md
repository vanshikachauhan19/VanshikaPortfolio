## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Vite)

- **Deployment**: Vercel Ready

## 📦 Setup & Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## ⚠️ Development Workflow (Crucial)

- **Development**: Always use `npm run dev`. This starts a hot-reloading server that reflects changes instantly.
- **Production Preview**: Use `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview` ONLY when you want to test the final production build.
- **Source Code**: All your edits must happen in the `src/` folder.
- **Do NOT Edit**: Never edit files inside the `dist/` folder. This folder is generated automatically and will be overwritten.

## ☁️ Deployment on Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub**
   - Initialize a git repo: `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
   - Push to a new GitHub repository.

2. **Deploy**
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
   - Click **Add New > Project**.
   - Import your GitHub repository.
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite (should be auto-detected).
   - Click **Deploy**.

That's it! Your site will be live.
